# Python Mission Chief Bot
A small bot for the game missionchief, on either the .com or .co.uk domains. Once you've provided it with a username and password and URL in the account.txt & url.txt files it will log in for you and run through the missions assigning vehicles. It will do so indefinitely. 

To use download the code, install Python then open up a cmd and type in the following:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`-


Once done open the account.txt and replace corresponding lines with your account information, and url.txt and enter the domain your account is registered such as `https://www.missionchief.co.uk/`

Once you're done, do the following in a cmd - it will run the bot for you.
`run missionchief_bot.py`

**This bot only works with a vanilla / default account, so don't expect it to work with custom callsigns.**
